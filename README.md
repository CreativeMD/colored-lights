# Colored Lights
A compromise solution to colored lighting in Minecraft by tinting based on area.
Normally, computing colored lighting would require excessive memory requirements which makes it unfortunately quite impractical. 
This mod takes a compromising approach that calculates light colors instead for each chunk corner, and smoothly blends between them within the chunk.
Although this solution is not perfect and does have noticeable issues, it achieves the general effect with minimal performance impact.
